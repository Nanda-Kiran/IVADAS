# IVADAS
IVADAS aims to deliver a secure, low-latency, cloud-native service for visual anomaly de- tection on factory imagery. The system integrates standard datasets (MVTec AD), strong baseline models (PatchCore, SoftPatch), and a production-style serving stack with gov- ernance, rollouts, and observability.
